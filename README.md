<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm MJ Stowe</h1>
<h5 align="center">PhD candidate</h5>
<h3 align="center">Drugs, Policy, Rights, Research, Activism</h3>

Drug-obsessed chemical alchemist turned behavioural epidemiologist, curious about all intersections of drugs, data and society.

Currently a PhD candidate in the [Kirby Institute](https://www.kirbyinstitute.org.au/) at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia. My research interests include applications of community-derived biomedical and epidemiological data in the public and population health fields, focusing on social and health components of systems that affect diverse populations of people who use drugs. 

I work on projects that focus on the meaningful inclusion of people who use drugs at all aspects of the research process - from design to implementation, evaluation and dissemination. Together, my varied interests coalesce around reducing drug-related social and health harms imposed on people who use drugs and improving the equitable invovlement of people who use drugs in research. Learn more about my research interests in [publications](/publication).
